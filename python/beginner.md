# Introduction

## Python as a first programming language

I personally think any language is good to start with as long as you have an interest in learning it. Having said that, Python is widely used as a first programming language because of its simple, user-friendly syntax, and there are many resources available for all levels.

If you are a complete beginner to programming, aside from syntax, you will need to learn new concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, etc. Python is a great way to learn these fundamentals!

## Python 2 or 3?

Some of these resources use Python 2. It's an older version of the language with outdated syntax. When you are going through a course, make sure you know what version you are using. 

Should you bother learning this older version, you ask? If you're a complete beginner, you'll need to learn the fundamental concepts anyway so it doesn't matter how it's taught. Of course, you can also just start with Python 3 so you're already up-to-date.

## Your End Goal

It's good to have an end goal when it comes to learning to program. Do you want to get a job, or is this purely a hobby? Do you want to make a game? Control a toy robot? Having a goal will guide your learning journey. For example, if your goal is to make games, you can check out the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library and tutorials after you've explored the basics of Python. If your goal is to get a job, you may want to look at web development with Python or learn data science, where Python is a preferred programming language.
